My name is Luis Henrique Moreno and I'm a frontend developer passionate about the web.

I've been working with web technologies since 2010. After two frontend internships I founded a company called Cia Web Sites in 2012, developing WordPress and PHP websites using HTML, Javascript and CSS. In January 2014 I decided to leave the company to dedicate to mobile apps development and I started to work at a startup called Hangar 18 which was developing an app similar to Uber at Brazil called Virtus. In September 2014 I decided to start another company, Pluritech, to develop hybrid and web apps.

Since 2014, I've been working all days with NodeJS, Angular, Ionic and Typescript. I also worked with ExpressJS, VueJS, React, Gulp, etc.

I believe in the web as a standard and being the future of mobile and I see the progressive web apps are the way to that. I'm a very enthusiast of Web Components.
