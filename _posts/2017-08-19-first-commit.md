Hello everyone, welcome to my personal website and blog and this is my first commit.

Inspired by a friend, Eduardo Camponez, who's doing a 100 day challenge, I decided to do one too. His challenge is write a blog post per day in the next 100 days and my challenge will be doing at least one commit on Github per day.

There won't be specific rules, but I promise won't commit something like a space in a file just to fulfill a task. There's no need to commit only codes and some days I can commit just a blog post in this website.

This challenge is starting today, August 19 and should finish November 27.
 
This space will be my collection of things I learned, specially about web technologies like Javascript.
